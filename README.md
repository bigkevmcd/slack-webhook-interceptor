# slack-webhook-interceptor

This is a [Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers) [EventListener interceptor](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/blob/master/examples/eventlisteners/eventlistener-interceptor.yaml) that can turnaround Slack "slash command" requests into JSON for further processing.

*This is a work-in-progress* blogpost to follow on how to use it.
